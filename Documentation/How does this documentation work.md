Consider this vault like a hybrid of Confluence and Jira.
Use Obsidian for best experience. This can also be viewed on any text reader since it is all a .md file. However, Obsidian preserves backlinks thus enabling navigation among documents.

There are two parts to this vault.

1. **The Agile Section:**
- The agile section works like Jira, containing backlogs for the current, future and past sprints. We are creating a new backlink for every ticket. Folders will help us categorise different sprints. Priority will be mentioned within the document itself.
- We are going to have different folders for the status of every single task. Requirement for a review by higher ups will be decided in the sprint meeting held everyday.
   
2. **Documentation:**
- The documentation section is going to function very much like confluence. The graph feature might be used to provide additional context to documents.
- All important information, minutes of meetings, brainstorm sessions, processes and progress of team members is going to be available in this section.
